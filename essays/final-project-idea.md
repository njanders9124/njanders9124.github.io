# Manoa Book Club
### The problem
   Our time spent at the university should be one of growth and a good way to start along this path is to develop a lifetime long love of learning. Currently, UH Manoa does not offer a book club which allows students to discuss various works of literature and foster a good reading habit.
### The Solution
The Manoa Reading Club would be a place for students to:<br>
 - Schedule future meetings regarding a certain book, for a synchronous in-person meeting on campus <br>
  - Post a book on the site, allowing other students to post reviews and have a discussion asynchronously<br>
  - Search books that have been posted

### Approach

The goal of this site would be to provide a local outlet for readers to meetup and discuss books together on campus. The website would have three roles Student, Organizer, and Admin.<br>
 - Students would be able to post books, post reviews under books, and signup for events.<br>
 - Organizers would be able to do everything a student can in addition to posting events.<br>
 - Admins would be able to do everything Students & Organizers can in addition to approving Organizer applications and moderating user posts.<br>
 
Information on events can be projected onto a map of UH Manoa to show their location and the library information for each book can be scraped aswell.

### Mockup Page ideas

Pages would include, but are not limited to:<br>
 - Landing page
 - Books page
 - Reviews page
 - Calendar page
 - Event page
 - Search page
 
 ### Use case ideas
 
 Possible use cases include, but are not limited to:
  - New user would create an account, browse the books pages for something they're interested in, see whether that book has any upcoming events, and signup for said events.
  - A long standing user could apply for Organizer status. After being approved by the admin, they can post events in the calendar page.
 - Admins login, browse applications, and moderate posts made under books and in events.
 
 ### Beyond the basics
 
Some future ideas:
 - Sort books by tags/keywords/topics
 - Have everything be chrome plated just like in spongebob
 - Have a 'friend' system. Students could add friends and see their posted reviews and signed up events
 - A ranking system allowing UH to develop a reading list of its own
