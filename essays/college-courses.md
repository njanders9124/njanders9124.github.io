#The Making of a College Course

###A little background

The immediate years following high school were a mess. First was a full summer and fall semester at LCC (pursuing a degree in Automotive Engineering). This was followed by a third of a spring semester where, in my infinite wisdom, I dropped out to pursue my dream of delivering pizza. After a few years of Hedonism, my dad convinced me to take some IT courses and start working as a computer technician on Pearl Harbor and then Camp Smith. The move from Pizza Delivery to IT showed me that through education, skill development, and heavy work ethic, that I could do more with myself than working just to work and never moving on from where I was. Once I was a technician, the growth didn't stop, I picked up a few more certifications, got promoted to senior technician then to tech lead, and built many working relationships with other people in my field.</br></br>
 
 It's with this background that I decided to return to University to pursue a degree for Computer Science and all of the growth and character development that came with it. This was never meant to be a simple resume checkoff or mindless pursuit, and my personal saving and investment put towards this degree ensures that. It was due to this reprieve from schooling, pursuit of job specialization, and personal investment that I developed certain criteria for great college courses and have little tolerance for professors who fail to meet that.

###Section two; three criteria for a good college course - LONGEST
Background growth inspired from college courses. Namely:
Primary goals (unimportant): direct knowledge, narrow in scope, very little carryover
Secondary skills (soft skills): indirectly gained, wider in scope, important in real world interactions
Tertiary character (growth and development): Almost unspoken, life long and character altering
###Seciton Three
"There have been precious few teachers that have been canonized in the history of my mind."
Personal list of classes that teach all three. Can't list ones that occured in most recent semester. Usually leave these to temper with age.

Chemistry 161, Reese.
Calculus 241, Garcia.
