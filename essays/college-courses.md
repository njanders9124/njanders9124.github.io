# The Making of a College Course



#### A little background
The immediate years following high school were a mess. First was a full summer and fall semester at LCC (pursuing a degree in Automotive Engineering). This was followed by a third of a spring semester where, in my infinite wisdom, I dropped out to pursue my dream of delivering pizza. After a few years of Hedonism, my dad convinced me to take some IT courses and start working as a computer technician on Pearl Harbor and then Camp Smith. The move from Pizza Delivery to IT showed me that through education, skill development, and heavy work ethic, that I could do more with myself than working just to work and never moving on from where I was. Once I was a technician, the growth didn't stop, I picked up a few more certifications, got promoted to senior technician then to tech lead, and built many working relationships with other people in my field.<br><br>
 
 It's with this background that I decided to return to University to pursue a degree for Computer Science and all of the growth and character development that came with it. This was never meant to be a simple resume checkoff or mindless pursuit, and my personal saving and investment put towards this degree ensures that. It was due to this reprieve from schooling, pursuit of job specialization, and personal investment that I developed certain criteria for great college courses and have little tolerance for professors (and students) who fail to meet them.<br><br><br><br>



#### University Culture of Education
College courses on surface are usually quite straightforward. The syllabus tells you what you need to do to earn an A, that plays out over a couple of months, then you get your grade. But I feel there's alot that isn't conveyed to the student on what they should be expecting from the course and, by extension, college and their degree. In addition to direct education of specific, niche topics (chemistry, calculus, creative writing) that have very little carryover into the 'real world' there are soft skills being to be developed and, hopefully, an undercurrent of personal growth and development. <br><br>
I'll talk a bit about the first since it's the most directly communicated to students (and also the reason for most students future disenchantment with education). Using Software Engineering(ICS314) as an example, students are told to expect alot of javascript, IDE's, and various software paraphernalia. This knowledge is the most easily imparted because of how direct it it. Follow this video checklist on PluralSight and you can consider yourself educated, only to enter the workforce and realize nothing you do is related to React, Meteor, or IntelliJ (and this is a computer science class, let alone a foreign literature course). Frustration abounds in students who enter into debt, and spend year toiling towards a degree, only to find out that the direct knowledge they've received is worthless compared to the OJT they'll receive at work or worse, leave them with a degree that gives them little to no hiring prospects in their field, as if the degree was supposed to be a kind of employment guarantee. These students feel cheated because they failed to realize the true importance of these classes.<br><br>
The secondary education can be 

Background growth inspired from college courses. Namely:
Primary goals (unimportant): direct knowledge, narrow in scope, very little carryover
Secondary skills (soft skills): indirectly gained, wider in scope, important in real world interactions
Tertiary character (growth and development): Almost unspoken, life long and character altering



### Seciton Three
"There have been precious few teachers that have been canonized in the history of my mind."
Personal list of classes that teach all three. Can't list ones that occured in most recent semester. Usually leave these to temper with age.
S-tier
Chemistry 161, Reese.
Calculus 241, Garcia.
