# The Coronavirus and Daily Life
```
I think that you will all agree
that we are living in most interesting times.
(Hear, hear.)
I never remember myself a time
in which our history was so full,
in which day by day
brought us new objects of interest, and,
let me say also, new objects for anxiety.
(Hear, hear.)
```
~Sir Austen Chamberlain, Speech to Parliament, 1936

### On Family
I recently paid a visit to my parents house on the west side of the island to help my dad out with some chores. He doesn't have a truck anymore so he borrows mine when needed. After he got back from a trip to the dump, I asked if he was worried about the virus given his age, to which he responds, "If I live, great. If I die, it's someone else's problem." He continues to work his regular shifts during the week and hang out with the boys on weekend. <br><br>
My mom has taking the situation a little more seriously. She's changed her shopping schedule so she's at CostCo during non-peak hours, started changing as soon as she gets back from running errands, and has washed her hands so many times they've started cracking from dryness. She wiped down my steering wheel with a clorox wipe after my dad finished with the truck.<br>

### On Friends
Jack, a high school friend, is adjusting to life on no income. He hopes to return to work as a tutor soon. Until then, he's filed for his tax return and is hoping the recent bailout will provide him with enough to last through this storm. I've been bringing him dinner after I get off work and considering how to broach the topic of covering some of his bills without offending him. 

Adam, who I know through work, has been told he'll be working from home. A tall order considering his job mostly involves running network cables and managing switches. He's been slipping me various tasks that are impossible to do remotely and I've been asking him to take some of my work tickets that can be done remotely.

Micah, a hiking buddy, flew out to Long Island to help his siblings take care of their parents house while they're in the hospital fighting off the virus. I volunteered to take care of his house plants until he returns home. He texted me last night saying he'll be there for a while longer while they plan his fathers wake. 

### On Work
The building I work in has rapidly gone from ~1500 users to ~200. My managers, thoughtfully, scaled back the number of technicians supporting them from 12, to 6, then to 1. Me. The last few weeks have consisted of back to back dumpster fires.
 - Teleworking users were under the impression that USB devices were only prohibited within the building (they're prohibited from plugging in to any machine). As a result of this, there's been an exponential increase in security violations and computers being locked down.
 - Users have been watching youtube on their work computers while at home. Normally this isn't a problem when they're plugged into a port on base, but when they're VPN'd into the network from home they all run through one server. That server spent most of the first telework day overloaded and crashing. All nonessential sites have been blocked. 
 - The word "Corona-Vacation" has been sweeping through those who remain working on base to describe people who treat the phrase "work from home" as equivalent to "you've got the week off". In trying to stay productive we'll have to reach out to people who are teleworking only to find they haven't forwarded their phone, have no cell phone listed in their email, and sending them an email is tantamount to shouting at a tree.

### On School
The recent instruction and grading policy changes, while upsetting, were understandable in context and the professors response to this transition is admirable. While I only had three classes this semester, they all transferred the same quality they offered in class, online. Software engineering already had the fair share of it's 'learning' workload online with in-class time saved for working with partners and coding quizzes. Literature's biweekly discussion group has been moved on to Zoom which, while awkard at first, has become a fairly fluid way of discussing the previous few chapters. And the third unnamed course never emailed us throughout spring break, notified us on Monday 15 minutes after class was supposed to begin that we'd be meeting on Zoom for class here on out, then demonstrated he had no plan for this first class since he wasn't expecting it to be online. <br><br>
Online courses can only recreate the same grading framework college gives. You learn a thing (supposedly), do a thing, then get graded for it. They don't offer the same soft-skill development that in person courses do. Things like time management, interpersonal skills, communication, teamwork, etc. These things are absent from the online experience. If I wanted to look for information on topics I was interested in, Google would be my jumping off point, not UH. I came back to school for personal development, not a checklist of assignments.

### On Being Grateful
Having everyone staying at home and losing productivity in the process is upsetting and uncomfortable. It's not easy knowing that you can be working one day, then have the entire workforce freeze up overnight. Or having your entire life grind to a halt because nothing is open anymore. None of this will be easy and none of it will be nice. But it's better than the alternative.<br><br>
When medical capacity is exceeded <a href="https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/CAT.20.0080">healthcare changes</a>. Rather that being patient centered, the focus shifts to the community. You're assessed for survivability at the door and if you're deemed to have a low chance of living, <a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/wp-content/uploads/EUFgPDwVAAgGcPt.jpeg">you quite simply don't receive any treatment</a> because that would be taking away resources from someone with a chance. If you're taking up ICU space and your condition doesn't improve, your space is given to someone else. The elderly are made comfortable in their suffering and the immunodeficient are offered a prayer. This route is not an option when compared to staying at home and washing your hands.  <br><br><br><br>
If you've stuck around this long, I'd encourage you to donate to <a href="https://giving.uhfoundation.org/funds/12949504">the UH Student Relief Fund</a> for students who have been blindsided by real life, <a href="https://malamameals.org/">Malama Meals</a> a non profit that delivers food to the elderly and at risk during quarantine, or if you distrust organizational inefficiency reach out to friends and family to make sure they're surviving. If you're lacking financial stability but still want to contribute, <a href="https://foldingathome.org/start-folding/">Folding@Home</a> and <a href="https://boinc.bakerlab.org/">Rosetta@Home</a> are programs that take your computers spare processing power to simulate protein folds and find potential weaknesses. They're both currently running special projects related to the SARS-CoV2 virus which causes COVID19.
