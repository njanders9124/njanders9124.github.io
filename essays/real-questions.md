## Questions as an escalation

"We hired you to troubleshoot, not to ask us to do your job."

Questions shouldn't serve as an initial step, they should be escalating an already in progress train of thought. Showing others that you can not only think, but act, by yourself towards the solution of a problem will not only win you the guidance of an answer, but also the respect of your peers. Or at the very least, prevent from being ostricized.

When a problem is presented and the solution isn't clear, the first step should be to tinker. How does changing the input effect my programs output? Where in my program does it stop doing what I want it to? If I replace this part in my computer, will it produce a different error? This tinkering allows you to not only discover where a problem is coming from, but it allows you to learn more about the system that you're interacting with.

Questions comes into play afterwards, once all of your internal struggle has been exhausted and you're in need of either a new direction or a puzzle piece that isn't attainable on your own. How you ask these questions reflect more on who you are that you might realize.


## Real Questions

If the potential question asker has followed thru the tinker and exhaust steps, they're next stop is usually the internet. A quick google search here and there will either give them the information they need to soldier on after querying a few keywords, or they've discovered that their problem is a little more unique and might need the additional assistance of another technician.

## Thoughts from a Lead Technician

Work scenario
"A user can't reach this website"
vs
"I've tried to reach this website both on the secure network and on commercial internet, it only works on commercial but doesn’t work on the secure network. All users in the customers office are also unable to reach it but users on another site can. It’s pinging the domain controller but times out from there, who can I talk to about this issue?"

## Conclusion

actual reflection on questions "smartness", why they reflect on the person who asked them, and why RTFM is a valid response
