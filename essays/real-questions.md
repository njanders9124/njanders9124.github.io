## Thoughts from a Lead Technician

Work scenario
"A user can't reach this website"
vs
"I've tried to reach this website both on the secure network and on commercial internet, it only works on commercial but doesn’t work on the secure network. All users in the customers office are also unable to reach it but users on another site can. It’s pinging the domain controller but times out from there, who can I talk to about this issue?"

## Conclusion

actual reflection on questions "smartness", why they reflect on the person who asked them, and why RTFM is a valid response
